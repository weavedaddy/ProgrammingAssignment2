## This set of functions allows the user to compute the inverse of a matrix
## and store it in cache for use rather than re-calculating it when needed.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object that can cache it's inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
}
